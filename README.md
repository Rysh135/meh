## This is me
On the 12th day of the 5th month of the last year of the 2nd millenium I was born into this world.
The tales of my conquests and victories are beyond the scope of this README (not really),I'm currently engaged in mastering the mystic arts of Electronics and Communications. Over the years I've consumed numerous novels and other tomes, heavy rock and metal make me groove. Video games are life(3 lives actually :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:). I believe efficiency is essential in anything and hence the interest in algorithms.

>I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. 
>And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.
>Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.”
